# ideas-and-testing
Just a collection of ideas and code for potential projects

This year is committed to learning programming and getting to know if I like to work in this special field! Other stuff I am doing has to do with Project Management, User Testing, Process (Optimization) and Design. It's a very broad field I am trying to understand, but the diversity is just great! Along with this, I learn to understand all parties involved in a Product Development Process, too. 

Since I am currently studying Digital Media, I'm enjoying this period in which I'm allowed to make mistakes and learn from each one of them. It's so important to just start trying.
